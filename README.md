# Bike Sharing Analysis

In this project, we will analyze bike sharing data from Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., USA, for the period between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The data is aggregated on an hourly basis. This means that no initial and final locations of the individual rides are available, but only the total number of rides per hour. Nevertheless, additional meteorological information is available in the data, which could serve as a driving factor for identifying the total number of requests for a specific time frame (bad weather conditions could have a substantial impact on bike sharing demand).

**Our Analysis is broken down to the following section:**
- Preprocessing Temporal and Weather Features
- Registered versus Casual Use Analysis
- Analyzing Seasonal Impact on Rides 
- Hypothesis Tests to validate our analysis
- Analysis of Weather-Related Features
- Basic Time Series Analysis
